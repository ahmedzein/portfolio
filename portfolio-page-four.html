objective: The objective was to build an app to help individuals do their laundry with ease.

solution: If you have never done laundry before, there is no need to stress about it anymore. Laundry Time will take you step by step to ensure cleanliness and longevity of your clothes. A step by step laundry app can not be found in the App Store or on Google Play. The laundry apps that were available did not carry much help to the end user. My app will aim to satisfy all  user groups (adults, teenagers,etc.) with any type of washer and dryer combination they have in their homes. The overall design was to take a boring task and bring it to life, by adding colours that are easy on the eyes. The process of doing laundry is visual therefore most of the design elements are icons with minimal text. Laundry Time will show the correct settings based on the size of the load and type of clothes (whites, colours, black etc.) to apply to your washer or dryer for satisfying results. Why stop there? Let us give you guidelines on how to organize and separate your laundry correctly. Youâ€™ll Never make a mistake again.
