objective: The objective for the branding project was to select a local business and re-brand their company. The project includes a new logo, stationary package, and a logo standards guide.

solution: KFMA 313 takes pride in instructing the people in the traditional teachings of martial arts. The current logo contains many different images, which steers the eye off the page. The logo I have drawn still carries the meaning of the current logo with minimal imagery. The design contains three simple illustrations, a crescent, Yin and Yang symbol, and a flying kick stands. Each image holds a deep meaning to martial arts as well as KFMA 313. The first is the crescent represents Islam and new beginnings, I choose to break the crescent into five pieces to represent the Olympic rings in an abstract method. The second is the Yin and Yang, which interprets perfect balance. The third is the flying kick stands that explains itself, a move that should be mastered.
