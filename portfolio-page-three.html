objective: The objective was to build a single page website with lots of animations and Javascript.

solution: Designing for the web can be tricky but starting with something that you love will give you the best outcome. During the second year in the Graphic Design Program, students were given the freedom to use their creativity and think outside the box for the web development course. The assignment was to build a website using the knowledge learned up to date by adding new lessons learned each week. The new lessons included css animation and beginner and intermediate javascript functionality. The web page I choose to make is inspired by my favourite childhood movie and sport, Space Jam.  The web page was inspired by the original website but includes a twist to have everything on the basketball court in motion. All the illustrations were hand drawn and vectorized in Adobe Illustrator.
