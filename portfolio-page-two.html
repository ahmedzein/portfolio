objective: The objective of the package design is to conceptualize a design that is environmentally a better choice, unique, eye catching and directly appeals to their chosen target audience.

solution: The most sophisticated headphones product on the market is the Monster Beats by Dr.Dre. They are the fastest growing product in history because of their unique quality, that they provide. The headphones are considerably big and therefore need a suitable storage box along with the other materials that come with it. The main approach of my package design is to make it smaller, lighter, and environmentally friendly. I wanted to give the package a different visual appeal by making it in a shape of a cylinder, it makes the product stand out on the shelves. The cylinder can either stand or sit on its side without rolling over due to its slightly flat side. The two circle ends can be both opened to access the product on either side. The product will not fall out, or slide around in the cylinder. The cylinder design has reduced the previous packaging about 35% and uses 65% fewer materials. The cylinder design is more environmentally friendly and is in a unique package compared to its competitors.
